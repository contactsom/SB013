1. Overloading
    1.1 Operator Overloading
    1.2 Method Overloading
    1.3 Constructor Overloading

2. Overriding
    2.1 Method Overriding
    2.2 Constructor Overriding

Two Method are said to be overloaded IFF :
    1. Method name Should be same
    2. Method Argument Must be different

    Note :
    In python method overloading NOT possible.
    If we are trying to declare the multiple method with the same name and different number of Arguments
    then Python will always CONSIDER ONLY LAST METHOD
